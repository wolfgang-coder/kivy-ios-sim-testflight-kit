# kivy-ios-sim-testflight-kit
A ready-to-run shell workflow that builds a **Kivy / KivyMD** app for the **iOS Simulator**, archives it for **App Store Connect**, exports an **.ipa**, and uploads via **fastlane** — including hardened fixes for the 17.x Simulator black‑screen issue (SDL2 RGBA8) and the Pillow/libpython static-lib hiccup.
